                        Inspired by true stories, Daksh Tyagi's witty and hugely entertaining book 'An Indian citizen's guide on how to avoid A Nation of Idiots' takes on the uncomfortable, the unsettling, and the often misunderstood modern Indian life.
                        WE INDIANS ARE AN INTERESTING BUNCH.
                        Intolerant to the debate on intolerance, but tolerant of religious intolerance. We cling onto age-old traditions, but a holiday can alter our accent. To us, caste and community is a badge of trust, religion is a line of control and a godman is an anti-depressant.
                        We won't stop at a zebra crossing, but we will damn well stop on it. We build things to prove our worth and break things to prove a point. We love the concept of independence, but we need our parents to help raise our kids. And we scripted the Kamasutra. Easy to forget, since we also ruined sex.
                        So how do we tell the real from the farcical? The farcical from the nutty? And the nutty from the downright ridiculous?
                        Easy. We just go along.
                        Daksh Tyagi's funny and insightful 'A Nation of Idiots' is the ideal guide to surviving the modern Indian life with your scruples intact.

                        <br>India, That Is Bharat, the first book of a comprehensive trilogy, explores the influence of European 'colonial consciousness' (or 'coloniality'), in particular its religious and racial roots, on Bharat as the successor state to the Indic civilisation and the origins of the Indian Constitution.
                         It lays the foundation for its sequels by covering the period between the Age of Discovery, marked by Christopher Columbus' expedition in 1492, and the reshaping of Bharat through a British-made constitution-the Government of India Act of 1919.
                          This includes international developments leading to the founding of the League of Nations by Western powers that tangibly impacted this journey.
                            It also puts forth the concept of Middle Eastern coloniality, which preceded its European variant and allies with it in the context of Bharat to advance their shared antipathy towards the Indic worldview.
                            In order to liberate Bharat's distinctive indigeneity, 'decoloniality' is presented as a civilisational imperative in the spheres of nature, religion, culture, history, education, language and, crucially, in the realm of constitutionalism.<br/></span>

                        People say when you want to change your life, you need to set big goals. But they’re wrong. World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler system for transforming your life.
                         He knows that lasting change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions – doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.
                          He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clear reveals how these tiny changes will help you get 1 percent better every day. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone) and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter.
                           Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs and distinguished scientists who have used the science of small habits to stay productive, motivated and happy.
                         These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships and your life.</span>

                    <span class="menu__detail">Advait has since long been revered as the crown jewel of all spiritual philosophies.
                         However, there are very few books, if any at all, that practically demonstrate the presence, applications, methods, and benefits of living as per the golden teaching of Advait-Vedanta.
                         This book is a much-needed and rare attempt to bring spirituality and philosophical teachings to everyday life. 
                         The author's genius lies in being delightfully able to bridge the abstract world of theorizations and principles with day-to-day circumstances, happenings, emotions, and relationships. 
                         With the author, Advait is no longer a transcendental idea, rather it is something that breathes, lives, and grows with us in our routine affairs, and enriches our life and our world as a blessing. 
                         The fun starts when the otherwise intimidating philosophy is revealed to the reader as immensely intimate and easily, practically implementable. 
                        This is a book not just for the mind, but for life.</span>

                    <span class="menu__detail">In an era where a great variety of cuisines are just a restaurant away, it has become difficult to choose what to eat.
                         Food products labelled 'healthy' one day are abruptly dismissed as 'lethal' the very next, while 'celebrity diets' are trashed by nutritionists.
                        So what is the correct diet for your body? The answer lies within. In the Yogic tradition, food is alive, with a prana of its own. When consumed, the quality of the food influences the qualities of your body and mind.
                        In A Taste of Well-Being, you will find recipes that have been perfected in the Isha Yoga Centre kitchen. Ranging from simple juices and salads to complete meals of grains, cereals and curries, the recipes are peppered with profound insights from Sadhguru on the process of eating and digestion.
                         A book that will help you discover the potential that lies within you and the joy you can derive from the simple act of eating.</span>

                    <span class="menu__detail">‘When Jayaprakash Narayan, the leader of the JP movement in north India, pressed for the resignation of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, it prompted her to impose internal Emergency.
                         In this fascinating account, Bipan Chandra traces the events that led up to this moment and makes some startling revelations.
                          He finds that there was a real danger of the JP movement turning fascist, given the fuzzy ideology of Total Revolution, its confused leadership and dependence on the RSS for its organization.
                           At the same time, despite the authoritarianism inherent in the Emergency, particularly with the rising power of Sanjay Gandhi and his Youth Congress brigade, Indira Gandhi did end it and call for elections. 
                        Finely argued, incisive and original, this book offers significant insight into those turbulent years and joins the ever-relevant debate on the acceptable limits of popular protest in a democracy</span>

                    <span class="menu__detail">The New York Times bestseller by the acclaimed, bestselling author of Start With Why and Together is Better. Now with an expanded chapter and appendix on leading millennials, based on Simon Sinek's viral video "Millenials in the workplace" (150+ million views). Imagine a world where almost everyone wakes up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valued during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled. This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, in many successful organizations, great leaders create environments in which people naturally work together to do remarkable things.  In his work with organizations around the world, Simon Sinek noticed that some teams trust each other so deeply that they would literally put their lives on the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what incentives are offered, are doomed to infighting, fragmentation and failure. Why?The answer became clear during a conversation with a Marine Corps general. "Officers eat last," he said. Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ate first while the most senior Marines took their place at the back of the line. What's symbolic in the chow hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: Great leaders sacrifice their own comfort--even their own survival--for the good of those in their care.      Too many workplaces are driven by cynicism, paranoia, and self-interest. But the best ones foster trust and cooperation because their leaders build what Sinek calls a "Circle of Safety" that separates the security inside the team from the challenges outside. Sinek illustrates his ideas with fascinating true stories that range from the military to big business, from government to investment banking.</span>
