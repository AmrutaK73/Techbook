# Techbook
Techbook is my first project. I, Amruta and Ankita my friend (classmate) we both worked as a little team for it. 

Reading is a very good habit that one needs to develop in life. Good books can inform you, enlighten you and lead you in the right direction. There is no better companion than a good book.
An eBook is a non-editable, reflowable book that is converted to a digital format to be read on any digital device such as computer screens or mobile devices.

# Our purpose behind choosing this book website topic is...

Environmental issues and ecological imbalance in nature has resulted in the devastation of various natural resources that has ultimately posed risk to mankind and nature. Our planet earth is suffering from numerous problems like pollution, deforestation, global warming, climatic changes and much more.

Vision: 
eBooks are portable and lightweight, making it easy to carry around.
The aim of eBooks is to simplify and enhance the overall learning experience. Digital Books make the learning process more interactive and engaging.

Instead of listening to one person continuously talking, students can now actively participate in the learning process. Integrating eBooks into classroom teaching makes learning a fun and engaging experience. Gone are the days when students had to carry a bag full of books every day to classrooms and back home.

With eBooks entering the educational domain, one device is enough to include the entire year’s syllabus. These digital books can be introduced to students at a very young age, right from kindergarten to university level, ensuring that learning never becomes boring for them!

So, we have built a website with help of HTML,CSS and Js
We decide which e-books we want to sell as well as provide few free ebooks , then join the affiliate programs that issue links for those products.

Techbook is website which provide services related to e books.
